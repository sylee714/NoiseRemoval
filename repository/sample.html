Obtaining information resources relevant to an information need
 
</div>
<p>
<b> Information retrieval </b> ( <b> IR </b> ) is the activity of obtaining resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources. Searches can be based on or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the that describes data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds. 
</p>
<p>
Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called . An IR system is a software system that provides access to books, journals and other documents; stores and manages those documents. are the most visible .

<p>
An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of . 
</p>
<p>
An object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or . User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching. 
</p>
<p>
Depending on the the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, audio, or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or . 
</p>
<p>
Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.

The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article by in 1945. It would appear that Bush was inspired by patents for a 'statistical machine' - filed by in the 1920s and '30s - that searched for documents stored on film. The first description of a computer searching for information was described by Holmstrom in 1948, detailing an early mention of the computer. Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s: one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy, . In the 1960s, the first large information retrieval research group was formed by at Cornell. By the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents). Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s. 
</p>
<p>
In 1992, the US Department of Defense along with the (NIST), cosponsored the (TREC) as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very large text collection. This catalyzed research on methods that to huge corpora. The introduction of has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even further.

For effectively retrieving relevant documents by IR strategies, the documents are typically transformed into a suitable representation. Each retrieval strategy incorporates a specific model for its document representation purposes. The picture on the right illustrates the relationship of some common models. In the picture, the models are categorized according to two dimensions: the mathematical basis and the properties of the model.

The evaluation of an information retrieval system' is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users. In general, measurement considers a collection of documents to be searched and a search query. Traditional evaluation metrics, designed for
